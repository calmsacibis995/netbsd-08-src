# configure all of the interfaces which we know about.
# do this by reading /etc/hostname.* files, where * is the name
# of a given interface.
#
# these files are formatted like the following, but with no # at the
# beginning of the line
#
# addr_family hostname netmask broadcast_addr options
# dest dest_addr
#
# addr_family is the address family of the interface, generally inet
# hostname is the host name that belongs to the interface, in /etc/hosts.
# netmask is the network mask for the interface.
# broadcast_addr is the broadcast address for the interface
# options are misc. options to ifconfig for the interface.
#
# dest is simply the string "dest" (no quotes, though) if the interface
# has a "destination" (i.e. it's a point-to-point link, like SLIP).
# dest_addr is the hostname of the other end of the link, in /etc/hosts
#
# the only required contents of the file are the addr_family field
# and the hostname.
