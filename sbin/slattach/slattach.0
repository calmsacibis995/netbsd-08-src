     SSllaattttaacchh is used to assign a tty line to a network interface, and to de-
     fine the network source and destination addresses.  The following
     operands are supported by ssllaattttaacchh:

     -_a            Autoenable the VJ header compression option, if the other
                   end of the link is capable of VJ header compression then it
                   will be used otherwise normal headers will be used.

     -_c            Enables the VJ header compression option.  Note that both
                   ends of the link must be able to use VJ header compression
                   for this to work.

     -_h            Turn on cts/rts style flow control on the slip port, by de-
                   fault no flow control is done.

     -_n            Throw away ICMP packets.  The slip interface will ignore
                   ICMP packets to prevent slow lines being saturated by ICMP
                   responses.

     -_s _b_a_u_d_r_a_t_e   Specifies the speed of the connection. If not specified,
                   the default of 9600 is used.

     _t_t_y_n_a_m_e       Specifies the name of the tty device.  _T_t_y_n_a_m_e should be a
                   string of the form `ttyXX', or `/dev/ttyXX'.

     Only the super-user may attach a network interface.

     To detach the interface, use ``ifconfig interface-name down'' after
     killing off the ssllaattttaacchh process.  _I_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e-_n_a_m_e is the name that is
     shown by netstat(1)
