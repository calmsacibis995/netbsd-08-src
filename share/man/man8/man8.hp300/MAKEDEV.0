       The shell script _M_A_K_E_D_E_V, found in the ``/dev'' directory,
       is used to create the  common  special  files.   See  _s_p_e-
       _c_i_a_l(8) for a more complete discussion of special files.

       _M_A_K_E_D_E_V  takes  any  number  of device names as arguments,
       where the  names  are  the  common  abbreviation  for  the
       device.   There  are  two  special  devices,  ``std''  and
       ``local''.  The former creates the  standard  devices  for
       the  architecture.   The latter is for devices specific to
       the   local   site,   and   executes   the   shell    file
       ``MAKEDEV.local''.

       The  HP300 supports the following devices.  Where a device
       name is followed by a hash sign  (``#''),  the  hash  sign
       must be replaced by a unit number.

       std       the standard devices (console, drum, fd/*, klog,
                 kmem, mem, null, stderr, stdin, stdout, tty)
