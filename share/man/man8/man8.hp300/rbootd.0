     RRbboooottdd services boot requests from Hewlett-Packard workstations over a
     local area network.  All boot files must reside in the boot file directo-
     ry; further, if a client supplies path information in its boot request,
     it will be silently stripped away before processing.  By default, rrbboooottdd
     only responds to requests from machines listed in its configuration file.

     RRbboooottdd supports the following command line options:

     --aa      Respond to boot requests from any machine.  With this option, the
             configuration file is ignored.

     --dd      Run server in debug mode.  Packets sent and received are dis-
             played to the terminal.

     _C_o_n_f_i_g_F_i_l_e
             Specify a different configuration file.

     The configuration file consists of ascii text where each line describes a
     particular machine.  A line must start with a machines' _e_t_h_e_r_n_e_t _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
     followed by an optional list of _b_o_o_t _f_i_l_e _n_a_m_e_s. An ethernet address is
     specified in hexadecimal with each of its six octets separated by a
     colon.  The boot file names come from the boot file directory.  The eth-
     ernet address and boot file(s) must be separated by white-space and/or
     commas.  A pound sign causes the remainder of a line to be ignored.  Here
     is a sample configuration file:

     #
     # ethernet addr   boot file(s)       comments
     #
     08:00:09:0:66:ad  SYSHPBSD          # snake (4.3BSD)
     08:00:09:0:59:5b                    # vandy (anything)
     8::9:1:C6:75      SYSHPBSD,SYSHPUX  # jaguar (either)

     RRbboooottdd logs status and error messages via syslog.  A startup message is
     always logged, and in the case of fatal errors (or deadly signals) a mes-
     sage is logged announcing the server's termination.  In general, a non-
     fatal error is handled by ignoring the event that caused it (e.g. an in-
     valid Ethernet address in the config file causes that line to be invali-
     dated).

     The following signals have the specified effect when sent to the server
     process using the kill(1) command.

     SIGHUP      Drop all active connections and reconfigure.

     SIGUSR1     Turn on debugging, do nothing if already on.  (SIGEMT on old-
                 er systems without SIGUSR1)

     SIGUSR2     Turn off debugging, do nothing if already off.  (SIGFPE on
                 older systems without SIGUSR2)

     If more than one server is started, both will receive and respond to the
     same boot packets.
