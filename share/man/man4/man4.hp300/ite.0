     TTY special files of the form ``ttye?''  are interfaces to the HP ITE for
     bit-mapped displays as implemented under BSD UNIX. An ITE is the main
     system console on most HP300 workstations and is the mechanism through
     which a user communicates with the machine.  If more than one display ex-
     ists on a system, any or all can be used as ITEs with the limitation that
     only the first one opened will have a keyboard (since only one keyboard
     is supported).

     ITE devices use the HP-UX `300h' termcap(5) or terminfo(5) entries.  How-
     ever, as currently implemented, the ITE does not support the full range
     of HP-UX capabilities for this device.  Missing are multiple colors, un-
     derlining, blinking, softkeys, programmable tabs, scrolling memory and
     keyboard arrow keys.  The keyboard does not have any of the international
     character support of HP's NLS system.  It does use the left and right
     _e_x_t_e_n_d _c_h_a_r keys as meta keys, in that it will set the eighth bit of the
     character code.

     Upon booting, the kernel will first look for an ITE device to use as the
     system console (/_d_e_v/_c_o_n_s_o_l_e). If a display exists at any hardware ad-
     dress, it will be the console.  The kernel looks for, in order: a 98544,
     98545, or 98547 Topcat display, a 98700 Gatorbox at a supported address
     (see gb(4)),  or a 98720 Renaissance at a supported address (see rb(4)).
     Currently there is no ITE support for the 98548, 98549, 98550 and 98556
     boards.

     When activated as an ITE (special file opened), all displays go through a
     standard initialization sequence.  The frame buffer is cleared, the ROM
     fonts are unpacked and loaded into off-screen storage and a cursor ap-
     pears.  The ITE initialization routine also sets the colormap entry used
     to white.  Variable colors are not used, mainly for reasons of simplici-
     ty.  The font pixels are all set to 0xff and the colormap entry corre-
     sponding to all planes is set to R=255, G=255 and B=255.  The actual num-
     ber of planes used to display the characters depends on the hardware in-
     stalled.  Finally, if the keyboard HIL device is not already assigned to
     another ITE device, it is placed in ``cooked'' mode and assigned to this
     ITE.

     On most systems, a display is used both as an ITE (/_d_e_v/_t_t_y_e? aka
     /_d_e_v/_c_o_n_s_o_l_e) and as a graphics device (/dev/grf?). In this environment,
     there is some interaction between the two uses that should be noted.  For
     example, opening /_d_e_v/_g_r_f_0 will deactivate the ITE, that is, write over
     whatever may be on the ITE display.  When the graphics application is
     finished and /_d_e_v/_g_r_f_0 closed, the ITE will be reinitialized with the
     frame buffer cleared and the ITE colormap installed.
