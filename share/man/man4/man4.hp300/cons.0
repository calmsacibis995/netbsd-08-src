     ccoonnss - HP300 console interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This release supports a ``virtual'' console device used for _k_e_r_n_e_l _p_r_i_n_t_f
     messages and accessed in user mode via /_d_e_v/_c_o_n_s_o_l_e. It is virtual in the
     sense that it is attached to a hardware interface at boot time.  Current-
     ly the choices are limited to: a bit-mapped display acting as an _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l
     _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _e_m_u_l_a_t_o_r ``ITE'', the builtin serial interface dca(4),  or a
     null(4) console in that order.
