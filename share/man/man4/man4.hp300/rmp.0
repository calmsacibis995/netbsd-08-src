     Hewlett-Packard's Remote Maintenance Protocol family is a collection of
     protocols layered atop IEEE 802.3. The current implementation of the RMP
     family provides protocol support only for the SOCK_RAW socket type.  As a
     result, sendto(2) and recvfrom(2) must be used to send and receive RMP
     packets.

     The format of an RMP packet is defined in the include file
     <_n_e_t_r_m_p/_r_m_p__v_a_r._h>. The RMP packet arrives encapsulated in an (HP extend-
     ed) IEEE 802.2 packet.  The IEEE 802.2 packet is preceded by the kernel
     address of an _i_f_n_e_t _s_t_r_u_c_t which is used to `route' a packet out the same
     interface it arrived on.  Outgoing packets are encapsulated in a standard
     IEEE 802.3 packet, while incoming packets have this information stripped
     away.

     RMP (IEEE 802.3) addresses are 6 octets in length (48 bytes).  Sockets in
     the Remote Maintenance Protocol family use the following addressing
     structure:

           struct sockaddr_rmp {
                   short           srmp_family;
                   u_char          srmp_dhost[6];
           };

     The RMP protocol family supported by the operating system is currently
     comprised of the Boot Protocol (_p_r_o_t_o=RMPPROTO_BOOT). Unfortunately, we
     have no documentation on the Remote Maintenance Protocol and only sketchy
     information about the Boot Protocol.

     oo   The HP ROM uses IEEE 802.3 (as opposed to Ethernet) packets.  While
         the kernel heuristically recognizes these packets, a more general
         mechanism for doing so should be provided.

     oo   The HP ROM uses a multicast address when first trying to locate boot
         servers.  While the Ethernet [sic] board is programmed to recognize
         this particular multicast address (9:0:9:0:0:4), a more general mech-
         anism for doing so should be provided.

     oo   The kernel supports only RAW sockets for the RMP protocol.  This is
         either a bug or a feature, since the kernel is smaller at the price
         of greater complexity in the server.

     oo   There is no support for bind'ing  an address in the RMP domain.
         Something like an RMPADDR_ANY should be provided to prevent more than
         one rbootd server from running at the same time.
