       _E_l_v_i_s is a text editor which emulates _v_i/_e_x.

       On  systems  which  pass  the program name as an argument,
       such as Unix and Minix, you may also install  _e_l_v_i_s  under
       the  names  "ex",  "vi", "view", and "input".  These extra
       names would normally be links to elvis; see the "ln" shell
       command.

       When  _e_l_v_i_s  is  invoked  as  "vi",  it behaves exactly as
       though it was invoked as "elvis".  However, if you  invoke
       _e_l_v_i_s as "view", then the readonly option is set as though
       you had given it the "-R" flag.  If you  invoke  _e_l_v_i_s  as
       "ex",  then  _e_l_v_i_s will start up in the colon command mode
       instead of the visual command  mode,  as  though  you  had
       given it the "-e" flag.  If you invoke _e_l_v_i_s as "input" or
       "edit", then _e_l_v_i_s will start up in input mode, as  though
       the "-i" flag was given.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --rr     To  the  real  vi,  this flag means that a previous
              edit should be recovered.   _E_l_v_i_s,  though,  has  a
              separate  program, called _e_l_v_r_e_c(_1), for recovering
              files.  When you invoke _e_l_v_i_s with -r,  _e_l_v_i_s  will
              tell you to run _e_l_v_r_e_c.

       --RR     This sets the "readonly" option, so you won't acci-
              dentally overwrite a file.

       --tt _t_a_g This causes _e_l_v_i_s to start  editing  at  the  given
              tag.

       --mm [_f_i_l_e]
              _E_l_v_i_s  will  search through _f_i_l_e for something that
              looks like an error message from  a  compiler.   It
              will then begin editing the source file that caused
              the error, with the  cursor  sitting  on  the  line
              where the error was detected.  If you don't explic-
              itly name a _f_i_l_e, then "errlist" is assumed.

       --ee     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in colon command mode.

       --vv     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in visual command mode.

       --ii     _E_l_v_i_s will start up in input mode.

       --ww _w_i_n_s_i_z_e
              Sets the "window" option's value to _w_i_n_s_i_z_e.

       ++_c_o_m_m_a_n_d or --cc _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
              If you use the +_c_o_m_m_a_n_d parameter, then  after  the
              first  file  is loaded _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed as an EX
              command.  A typical example would  be  "elvis  +237
              foo",  which would cause _e_l_v_i_s to start editing foo
              and then move directly to line 237.  The  "-c  _c_o_m-
              _m_a_n_d"  variant  was added for UNIX SysV compatibil-
              ity.

FFIILLEESS
       /tmp/elv*
              During editing, _e_l_v_i_s stores text  in  a  temporary
              file.   For  UNIX, this file will usually be stored
              in the /tmp directory, and the first three  charac-
              ters  will be "elv".  For other systems, the tempo-
              rary files may be stored someplace  else;  see  the
              version-specific section of the documentation.

       tags   This  is the database used by the :_t_a_g_s command and
              the --tt  option.   It  is  usually  created  by  the
              _c_t_a_g_s(_1) program.

       .exrc or elvis.rc
              On UNIX-like systems, a file called ".exrc" in your
              home directory is executed as a series of  _e_x  com-
              mands.   A file by the same name may be executed in
              the current directory, too.  On  non-UNIX  systems,
              ".exrc" is usually an invalid file name; there, the
              initialization file is called "elvis.rc" instead.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       TERM   This is the name of your terminal's  entry  in  the
              termcap  or  terminfo  database.  The list of legal
              values varies from one system to another.

       TERMCAP
              Optional.  If your system  uses  termcap,  and  the
              TERMCAP variable is unset, then
               will   read   your   terminal's   definition  from
              //eettcc//tteerrmmccaapp.  If TERMCAP is set to the full  path-
              name  of  a  file  (starting with a '/') then  will
              look in the named file instead of //eettcc//tteerrmmccaapp.  If
              TERMCAP  is set to a value which doesn't start with
              a '/', then its value is assumed  to  be  the  full
              termcap entry for your terminal.

       TERMINFO
              Optional.   If  your  system uses terminfo, and the
              TERMINFO variable is unset, then
               will read  your  terminal's  definition  from  the
              database  in  the  //uussrr//lliibb//tteerrmmiinnffoo  database.  If
              TERMINFO is set, then its  value  is  used  as  the
              database  name to use instead of //uussrr//lliibb//tteerrmmiinnffoo.

       LINES, COLUMNS
              Optional.  These variables, if set,  will  override
              the   screen   size   values  given  in  the  term-
              cap/terminfo for your terminal.  On windowing  sys-
              tems  such as X,  has other ways of determining the
              screen size, so you  should  probably  leave  these
              variables unset.

       EXINIT Optional.  This variable can hold EX commands which
              will be executed before any .exrc files.

       SHELL  Optional.  The  SHELL  variable  sets  the  default
              value  for  the  "shell"  option,  which determines
              which shell program is  used  to  perform  wildcard
              expansion  in file names, and also which is used to
              execute filters or external programs.  The  default
              value on UNIX systems is "/bin/sh".

              Note: Under MS-DOS, this variable is called COMSPEC
              instead of SHELL.

       HOME   This variable should be set to  the  name  of  your
              home directory.
               looks  for  its initialization file there; if HOME
              is unset then the initialization file will  not  be
              executed.

       TAGPATH
              Optional.   This variable is used by the "ref" pro-
              gram, which is invoked by the  shift-K,  control-],
              and :tag commands.  See "ref" for more information.

       TMP, TEMP
              These optional environment variables are only  used
              in non-UNIX versions of .  They allow you to supply
              a directory name to be used for  storing  temporary
              files.

       There is no LISP  support.   Certain  other  features  are
       missing, too.

       Auto-indent mode is not quite compatible with the real vi.
       Among other things, 0^D and ^^D don't do  what  you  might
       expect.

       Long  lines  are displayed differently.  The real vi wraps
       long lines onto multiple rows of  the  screen,  but  _e_l_v_i_s

       Many  other  people  have  worked to port _e_l_v_i_s to various
       operating systems.  To see who deserves  credit,  run  the
       :_v_e_r_s_i_o_n command from within _e_l_v_i_s, or look in the system-
       specific section of the complete documentation.
