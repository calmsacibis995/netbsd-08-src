     HHttaabbllee is used to convert host files in the format specified in Internet
     RFC 810 to the format used by the network library routines.  Three files
     are created as a result of running hhttaabbllee: _h_o_s_t_s, _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, and _g_a_t_e_w_a_y_s.
     The hosts file may be used by the gethostbyname(3) routines in mapping
     host names to addresses if the nameserver, named(8),  is not used.  The
     _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s file is used by the getnetent(3) routines in mapping network
     names to numbers.  The _g_a_t_e_w_a_y_s file may be used by the routing daemon in
     identifying ``passive'' Internet gateways; see routed(8) for an explana-
     tion.

     Options available for hhttaabbllee:

     --cc _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d-_n_e_t_s
             If the gateways file is to be used, _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d-_n_e_t_s is a list of
             networks to which the host is directly connected.  The networks,
             separated by commas, may be given by name or in Internet-standard
             dot notation, for example:

                   -c arpanet,128.32,local-ether-net.

             HHttaabbllee only includes gateways which are directly connected to one
             of the networks specified, or which can be reached from another
             gateway on a connected net.

     --ll _l_o_c_a_l-_n_e_t_s
             If the --ll option is given with a list of networks (in the same
             format as for --cc), these networks will be treated as ``local,''
             and information about hosts on local networks is taken only from
             the localhosts file.  Entries for local hosts from the main
             database will be omitted.  This allows the localhosts file to
             completely override any entries in the input file.

     If any of the files _l_o_c_a_l_h_o_s_t_s, _l_o_c_a_l_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, or _l_o_c_a_l_g_a_t_e_w_a_y_s are pre-
     sent in the current directory, the file's contents is prepended to the
     output file.  Of these, only the gateways file is interpreted.  This al-
     lows sites to maintain local aliases and entries which are not normally
     present in the master database.  Only one gateway to each network will be
     placed in the gateways file; a gateway listed in the localgateways file
     will override any in the input file.

     HHttaabbllee is best used in conjunction with the gettable(8) program which re-
     trieves the NIC database from a host.

     If the name-domain system provided network name mapping well as host name
     mapping, hhttaabbllee would no longer be needed.

     The hhttaabbllee command appeared in 4.2BSD.
