     SSwwaappiinnffoo displays statistics about the amount of free swap space on all
     of the swap areas compiled into the kernel.

     The following options are available:

     --kk      By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.  The
             --kk option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.

     Statistics are reported for all swap partitions configured into the ker-
     nel.  The first column is the device name of the partition.  The next
     column is the total space available in the partition.  The _U_s_e_d column
     indicates the total blocks used so far;  the _A_v_a_i_l_a_b_l_e column indicates
     how much space is remaining on each partition.  The _C_a_p_a_c_i_t_y reports the
     percentage of space used.

     If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
     of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the report.

     The information reported by sswwaappiinnffoo is stored in the kernel in a linked
     list.  Since we are merely reading this list out of kernel memory, it is
     entirely possible that the list could change as we try to read it.  Sus-
     picious and unrepeatable values are probably incorrect.

     Statistics are reported for all swap partitions compiled into the kernel,
     regardless of whether those partitions are being used.
