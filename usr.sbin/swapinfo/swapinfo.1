.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm swapinfo
.Op Fl k
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Swapinfo
displays statistics about the amount of free swap space on all of the 
swap areas compiled into the kernel.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.El
.Sh STATISTICS
Statistics are reported for all swap partitions configured into the kernel.
The first column is the device name of the partition.  The next column is
the total space available in the partition.  The 
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far;  the 
.Ar Available
column indicates how much space is remaining on each partition.
The
.Ar Capacity
reports the percentage of space used.
.Pp
If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the report.
.Sh "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The information reported by
.Nm swapinfo
is stored in the kernel in a linked list.  Since we are merely reading
this list out of kernel memory, it is entirely possible that the list could
change as we try to read it.  Suspicious and unrepeatable values are probably
incorrect.
.Pp
Statistics are reported for all swap partitions compiled into the kernel,
regardless of whether those partitions are being used.
