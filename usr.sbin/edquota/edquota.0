       _E_d_q_u_o_t_a  is a quota editor.  By default, or if the -_u flag
       is specified, one or more users may be  specified  on  the
       command  line.   For each user a temporary file is created
       with an ASCII representation of the  current  disk  quotas
       for  that  user.  The list of filesystems with user quotas
       is determined from /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b.  An editor  is  invoked  on
       the  ASCII  file.   The editor invoked is _v_i(1) unless the
       environment variable EDITOR specifies otherwise.

       The quotas may then be modified, new  quotas  added,  etc.
       Setting  a quota to zero indicates that no quota should be
       imposed.  Setting a hard limit to one  indicates  that  no
       allocations  should be permitted.  Setting a soft limit to
       one with a hard limit of zero indicates  that  allocations
       should  be  permitted  on  only  a temporary basis (see -_t
       below).  The current usage information in the file is  for
       informational  purposes; only the hard and soft limits can
       be changed.

       On leaving the editor, _e_d_q_u_o_t_a reads  the  temporary  file
       and modifies the binary quota files to reflect the changes
       made.

       If the --pp option is specified, _e_d_q_u_o_t_a will duplicate  the
       quotas  of  the  prototypical user specified for each user
       specified.  This is the normal mechanism used to  initial-
       ize quotas for groups of users.

       If  the  -_g  flag is specified, _e_d_q_u_o_t_a is invoked to edit
       the quotas of one or more groups specified on the  command
       line.   The  -_p  flag can be specified in conjunction with
       the -_g flag to specify a prototypical group to  be  dupli-
       cated among the listed set of groups.

       Users  are  permitted  to  exceed  their soft limits for a
       grace period that may be specified per  filesystem.   Once
       the  grace  period has expired, the soft limit is enforced
       as a hard limit.  The default grace period for a  filesys-
       tem is specified in /_u_s_r/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e/_u_f_s/_q_u_o_t_a._h.  The -_t flag
       can be used to change the grace period.   By  default,  or
       when invoked with the -_u flag, the grace period is set for
       all  the  filesystems  with  user  quotas   specified   in
       /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b.   When  invoked  with  the  -_g  flag the grace
       period is set for all the filesystems  with  group  quotas

       specified  in  /_e_t_c/_f_s_t_a_b.  The grace period may be speci-
       fied in days, hours, minutes, or seconds.  Setting a grace
       period  to  zero  indicates  that the default grace period
       should be imposed.  Setting a grace period to  one  second
       indicates that no grace period should be granted.

       Only the super-user may edit quotas.
