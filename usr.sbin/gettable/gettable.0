     GGeettttaabbllee is a simple program used to obtain the NIC standard host tables
     from a ``nicname'' server.  The indicated _h_o_s_t is queried for the tables.
     The tables, if retrieved, are placed in the file _o_u_t_f_i_l_e or by default,
     _h_o_s_t_s._t_x_t.

     Available option:

     --vv      Get just the version number instead of the complete host table
             and put the output in the file _o_u_t_f_i_l_e or by default, _h_o_s_t_s._v_e_r.

     GGeettttaabbllee operates by opening a TCP connection to the port indicated in
     the service specification for ``nicname''.  A request is then made for
     ``ALL'' names and the resultant information is placed in the output file.

     GGeettttaabbllee is best used in conjunction with the htable(8) program which
     converts the NIC standard file format to that used by the network library
     lookup routines.

     If the name-domain system provided network name mapping well as host name
     mapping, ggeettttaabbllee would no longer be needed.

     The ggeettttaabbllee command appeared in 4.2BSD.
