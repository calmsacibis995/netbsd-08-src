-------- Remove this line and what's below it, for reference only. --------

To ensure that your bug report is handled correctly by bugfiler(8),
you must replace "folder" (on the line above starting with "Index:")
with one of the following values:

	folder  ::= bin | doc | etc | games | ideas | include | lib
			| libexec | man | misc | sbin | share | sys.386bsd
			| usr.bin | usr.sbin

This value should match the part of directory that the bug is in
under /usr/src.  If it appears in more than one directory, use the
first one on the list.  If the place that it appears is not on the list
use the "misc" value.  If it is a suggestion use the "ideas" value.  If
it is a manual page problem use the "man" value.

If you're not running 386BSD-0.1.2.3, you should also replace
"386BSD-0.1.2.3" on the same line with one of the following values.

	version ::= 386BSD-0.1 | 386BSD-0.1.1 | 386BSD-0.1.2 | 386BSD-0.1.2.1
		               | 386BSD-0.1.2.2 | 386BSD-0.1.2.3

For example, if your bug concerns the program "/usr/bin/file" and
you're currently running 386BSD-0.1.2.4, you should replace "folder"
with "usr.bin/file", and "386BSD-0.1.2.3" with "386BSD-0.1.2.4".
